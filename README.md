# Introduction: 

BestBid is the World's First Sealed Bid NFT Platform. BestBid uses ZeroKnowledge Proofs to securely let users place their bids while their bids are being stored on the IPFS. BestBid has the functionality to create and list NFTs on the platform itself. Thus, creators and collectors alike can list their NFTs and sell them to the world at the best rate someone is willing to pay.

BestBid strives to promote more data security when it comes to conducting auctions. Sealed bid auctions are one where the identity of the bidders and the value of their bids are not disclosed to the public which in return provides the best value to the auctioneer and the price will not be affected by public bidding. BestBid lets the auctioneer set a minimum bid and users can bid accordingly.

BestBid has a featured listing also known as Live Auctions and an option to explore all other NFTs which are listed on the platform. BestBid as a platform provides its users a dark and light mode as well which is massive when it comes to UX. As for UX BestBid also makes use of animations and transitions to ensure the user falls in love with the platform.
