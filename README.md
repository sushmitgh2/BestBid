# Introduction: 

BestBid is the World's First Sealed Bid NFT Platform. BestBid uses ZeroKnowledge Proofs to securely let users place their bids while their bids are being stored on the IPFS. BestBid has the functionality to create and list NFTs on the platform itself. Thus, creators and collectors alike can list their NFTs and sell them to the world at the best rate someone is willing to pay.

BestBid strives to promote more data security when it comes to conducting auctions. Sealed bid auctions are one where the identity of the bidders and the value of their bids are not disclosed to the public which in return provides the best value to the auctioneer and the price will not be affected by public bidding. BestBid lets the auctioneer set a minimum bid and users can bid accordingly.

BestBid has a featured listing also known as Live Auctions and an option to explore all other NFTs which are listed on the platform. BestBid as a platform provides its users a dark and light mode as well which is massive when it comes to UX. As for UX BestBid also makes use of animations and transitions to ensure the user falls in love with the platform.

#Get Started

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
